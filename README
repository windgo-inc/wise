nimbones
--------

A skeleton project tree used internally for starting new nim modules quickly.
This comes with an infrastructure already set up for performing
pre-installation hooks, testing, and benchmarking in *nix environments.

ISSUES
 - Firefox ignores caching requests, occasionally multiple back to back uploads
   will bring up the same arrangement page.

TODO
 - Support other operating systems than *nix.
