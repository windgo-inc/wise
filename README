WISE
----

A simple document compiler for our own use within the lab. Uses nimPDF to
generate labelled figures from uploaded images, and ghostscript to compile
uploaded PDFs, text files, and images. Pulled together using jester, jquery,
jquery-ui, and an updated fork of emerald which is compatible with nim 0.17.2.
Not a secure service.

Shouts:
 - jester - Dominik Picheta
 - emerald - flyx

ISSUES
 - Firefox ignores caching requests, occasionally multiple back to back uploads
   will bring up the same arrangement page.

TODO
 - Support other operating systems than *nix.
